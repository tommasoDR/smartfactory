Task: Generate a SPARQL SELECT statement for querying a graph database.
For instance, to find all information about working time avg KPI, the following query in backticks would be suitable:
```PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX sa-ontology: <http://www.semanticweb.org/raffi/ontologies/2024/10/sa-ontology#>

SELECT ?description ?formula ?unit_measure ?atomic
WHERE {{
?kpi sa-ontology:id "working_time_avg" . 
?kpi sa-ontology:description ?description . 
?kpi sa-ontology:formula ?formula .
?kpi sa-ontology:unit_measure ?unit_measure . 
?kpi sa-ontology:atomic ?atomic .
}}```

The user question is to create a new dashboard to satisfy a need. Use the schema to map the user need onto one or more rdf:type. Then return <sa-ontology:id>, <sa-ontology:description>, <sa-ontology:formula> and <sa-ontology:unit_measure> of each KPI of that rdf:type.

Instructions:
Use only the node types and properties provided in the schema.
Do not use any node types and properties that are not explicitly provided.
Include all necessary prefixes.

Schema:
{schema}

Note: 
Be as concise as possible.

When naming a KPI, ensure the following format:
1. The KPI name must match the one found in <owl:NamedIndividual ...>, such as rdf:about="http://www.semanticweb.org/raffi/ontologies/2024/10/sa-ontology#offline_time_avg" for the KPI ID offline_time_avg.
2. Use lowercase letters for the first letter of each word.
3. Connect words using underscores (_).
4. Do not include spaces or special characters.
Example Format:
- Correct: offline_time_avg
- Incorrect: OfflineTimeAvg, offline time avg, or OFFLINE_TIME_AVG.
Always follow this convention when naming KPIs.

When generating a machine ID, ensure the following format:
1. Use uppercase letters for the first letter of each word in the machine name.
2. Separate each word with a single space.
3. Include the number as a separate substring at the end, if applicable.
Example Format:
- Correct: Assembly Machine 2
- Incorrect: assemblymachine2, AssemblyMachine2, or assembly machine 2.
Always follow this convention when generating machine IDs.

When naming a formula, ensure the following format:
1. Use the KPI IDs in lowercase, connected by underscores (_).
2. Use operators (e.g., /, +, -, *) between KPI IDs.
3. Do not include spaces or special characters, except for the mathematical operators.
Example Format:
- Correct: working_time_sum/operative_time
- Incorrect: WorkingTimeSum/OperativeTime, working_time_sum + operative_time, or working_time_sum operative_time.
Always follow this convention when naming formulas.

Do not include any explanations or apologies in your responses.
Do not respond to any questions that ask for anything else than for you to construct a SPARQL query.
Do not include any text except the SPARQL query generated.
For the query use only the format SELECT ... WHERE{{...}}.
Do not use UNION, FILTER or BIND.
