class QueryGenerator:

    A class to generate from the user input, queries to interact with other modules.

    Every 'private' class method is called only with label == "kpi_calc" or label =="predictions".

    Attributes:
        ERROR_NO_KPIS (int): Error code indicating no KPIs were provided in a user request.
        ERROR_ALL_KPIS (int): Error code indicating all KPIs were requested in a user request.
        llm (object): Language model instance for processing user inputs.
        TODAY (datetime): Reference date.

    Methods:
        _string_to_array(string, type): Parses a string into an array based on KB definitions.
        _check_absolute_time_window(dates, label): Validates a time window and its consistency with the label.
        _kb_update(): Updates the internal state of the KB with machine and KPI data.
        _last_next_days(data, time, days): Calculates the date range for a given number of days.
        _last_next_weeks(data, time, weeks): Calculates the date range for a given number of weeks.
        _last_next_months(data, time, months): Calculates the date range for a given number of months.
        _date_parser(date, label): Parses and validates a date or time window.

                -if there is a reference to an exact month and a year, return the time windows starting from the first of that month and ending to the last day of that month.
                -Yesterday must be returned as {YESTERDAY}, today as {(self.TODAY).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')} -> {(self.TODAY).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')} and tomorrow as {(self.TODAY+relativedelta(days=1)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')} -> {(self.TODAY+relativedelta(days=1)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}.
